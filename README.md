# <b>Infrastructure As Code API </b>

## <b>Repo description</b>

This a terraform repository for providing a simple Infrastructure for an API application in AWS. In this case, will provide the API from the [Elixir API repo](https://github.com/seavba/elixir-api).

The Infrastructure provided by this repo consists on an AWS ECS container over an AWS Fargate cluster serving an API application through an AWS ALB, which itÂ´s reached from the Internet thorugh the AWS IG. The container gets the data from an AWS RDS PGSQL database.

Security and target Groups, IAM policies, VPC and so on, are already provided by this repo.

## Getting Started

#### Pre-requisites
> :warning: Create ECR image (if you didn't do it before)

- [Elixir-api repo for creating image](https://github.com/seavba/elixir-api)

- AWS CLI must be already configured. If not, try [Configuration and credential file settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)

- The iac-api Terrafrom module has been wrote with Terraform v0.15.3.

#### Deploy
Once Elixir docker image has been created, for providing such infrastructure, it's needed to run:

```
cd /your/repo/path
git clone  git@github.com:seavba/iac-api.git
cd iac-api && terraform init && terraform apply
```
```terraform apply``` command asks for confirmation, write ```yes``` if you want to proceed with the deployment.


### Variables
All the variables to be customised (if needed) can be found in [variables.tf](https://github.com/seavba/iac-api/blob/master/variables.tf) file.

#### Mandatory variables to be defined:
- <b>ecr_repo_url</b> Must have the URL for the ECR repository to be used. For example: ```your_account_id.dkr.ecr.your_region.amazonaws.com```

#### Output Variables

After deployment, as output variables are shown:

```
Apply complete! Resources: 23 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

api_url = "elixirLB-81803355.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
elixirDB_endpoint = "elixir.cauwadl2xq0q.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432"
```

> :warning: <i>api_url</i>  variable is the URL to navigate through the API application. Once deployment is done, wait for 5 minutes and paste it on your browser. A Phoenix webpage must be shown

### Destroy Infrastructure

```
cd /your/repo/path
cd iac-api && terraform destroy
```
```terraform destroy``` command asks for confirmation, write ```yes``` if you want to proceed with the deployment revert.
